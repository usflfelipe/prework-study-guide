          <li>CSS is an abbreviation for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Sometimes, we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page. To do that, we use a special wild card symbol, or *</li>
          <li>The block value assigns each image to start on a new line.</li>
          <li> `link` element creates the connection to the external file.</li>
          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource.</li>
          <li>The href attribute specifies the location (URL) of the external resource.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JS is an abbreviation for JavaScript</li>
          <li>JavaScript is a high-level dynamic programming language that adds interactivity to your website. It was invented by Brendan Eich.</li>
          <li>APIs is an abbreviation for Application Programming Interfaces</li>
          <li>The script tag (< script src="scripts/main.js">< /script>) needs to be before the closing body tag</li>
          <li>A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is case sensitive.</li>
          <li>Variables are containers that store values/data in our code. You start by declaring a variable with the `var` keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable.</li>
          <li>After declaring a variable, you can give it a value: <br>
            myVariable = "Bob"; or let myVariable = "Bob";</li>
          <li>You retrieve the value by calling the variable name: <br>
            myVariable;</li>
          <li>After assigning a value to a variable, you can change it later in the code: <br>
            let myVariable = "Bob"; <br>
            myVariable = "Steve";</li>
            <li><b>JS data types</b>: <br>
              <br>
              <b>-String</b> is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single or double quote marks. <br>
              let myVariable = 'Bob'; or <br>
              let myVariable = "Bob"; <br>
              <br>
              <b>-Number</b>. Numbers don't have quotes around them.<br>
              <br>
              <b>-Boolean</b> is a True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords that don't need quote marks.<br>
              <br>
              <b>-Array</b> is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.<br>
              let myVariable = [1,'Bob','Steve',10];<br>
              Refer to each member of the array like this:<br>
              myVariable[0], myVariable[1], etc.<br>
              <br>
              <b>-Object</b> can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable.<br>
              let myVariable = document.querySelector('h1');<br>
              All of the above examples too.</li>
              <li>You can write comments in JavaScript just as you can in CSS:<br>
                /*<br>
                Everything in between is a comment.<br>
                */<br>
                If your comment contains no line breaks, it's an option to put it behind two slashes like this:<br>
                // This is a comment</li>
                <li>An <b>operator</b> is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables).<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>-Addition (+):</b> Add two numbers together or combine two strings.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>-Subtraction, Multiplication, Division (-, *, /):</b> These do what you'd expect them to do in basic math.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>-Assignment (=):</b> Assigns a value to a variable. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>-Strict equality (===):</b> This performs a test to see if two values are equal. It returns a true/false (Boolean) result.<br>
                  let myVariable = 3;<br>
                  myVariable === 4;<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>-Not, Does-not-equal (!, !==):</b> This returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes. It turns a true into a false, etc.. When it is used alongside the Equality operator, the negation operator tests whether two values are not equal.<br>
                  For "Not", the basic expression is true, but the comparison returns false because we negate it:<br>
                  let myVariable = 3;<br>
                  !(myVariable === 3);<br>
                  <br>
                  "Does-not-equal" gives basically the same result with different syntax. Here we are testing "is myVariable NOT equal to 3". This returns false because myVariable IS equal to 3: <br>
                  <br>
                  let myVariable = 3;<br>
                  myVariable !== 3;
                </li>
                <li>We can use the console.log method to output a message to the web console by adding an argument.</li>
                <li><b>Control flow</b> is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
                <li>Control flow can be interrupted, however. We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed, or if it is even executed at all.</li>
                <li>A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false. All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy.</li>
