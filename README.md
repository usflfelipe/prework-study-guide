# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created to help bootcamp students taking Prework. In it we learned a little bit of HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. We made a website that serves to write down everything we learned during Prework and it really helped a lot to organize our studies!

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The site works having initially 4 topics:<br>
HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript.<br>
In each topic we can see the notes we made during our Prework. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
